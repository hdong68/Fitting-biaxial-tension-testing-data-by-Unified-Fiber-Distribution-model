# Fitting-biaxial-tension-testing-data-by-Unified-Fiber-Distribution-model
This code is used to fit biaxial tension testing experimental data for biological tissues with planar distributed fibers using a Unified-Fiber-Distribution model. For details, please see: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509621000673

Step 1:
The biaxial tensile test results are placed in the “Selected_Data_5” folder. For details of the experimental tests, please refer to the article: Dong & Sun, J Mech Phys Solids (2021).

Step 2:
Run the code "fit_parameters_A_5p_one_by_one"
